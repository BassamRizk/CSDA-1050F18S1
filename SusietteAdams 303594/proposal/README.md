# Research Proposal

Introduction

Avaya Research Center is evaluating cost of living for both renters and home buyers in the major Canadian Cities. This information will provide a better understanding of what drives rent and housing cost. The focus will be to find fact based insights on meaningful patterns in the housing market. The drastic change in the Canadian housing market started back the late 2010 by foreign investors that lead to the increase in renting and owning a home in Canada. Real estate became the perfect long term investment option after a steady drop in interest rate. Owning a home is also an ideal need for young adults in Canada. The social pressure along with increasing opportunities for profit were driving the growth of the market, causing first time home buyers to struggle to find a place to live at a reasonable price.  
In this response the Canadian government decided to step in and attempt to slow and bring down prices naturally. In April 2017 Canada Federal Finance Minister, Bill Morneau, met with Charles Sousa and John Tory, to attempt to find a solution. As a result of this, they implemented a foreign buyer tax. This is because foreign purchase a lot of the homes that cause the housing price increase. Most of those homes are now rental properties. In addition, the provincial Fair Housing Plan set in place stricter rent controls. Uninsured renters are now required to pass a stress test in order to see if they can handle a rise in rates. Ontario has created a Fair Housing Plan made up of 16 points to help combat the growth and make homes more affordable. These 16 points are:

1.Non-resident speculation tax
2.Rent is only allowed to rise at rates posted in annual provincial rental increase guideline
3.Develop standard leases that would further help protect tenants and ensure landlords
4.Create program to balance the value of surplus land assets
5.Put a vacant properties tax into place
6.Tax to make sure new apartment complexes is similar to other current complex properties
7.Introduce a 5-year program to facilitate the building of more rental apartments
8.Make it easier to use property taxes to generate more development opportunity
9.Create Housing Supply team to help uncover and fix barriers to housing development
10.Work to fight tax avoidance practices
11.Reassess rules involving customer representation in real estate transactions
12.Creation of housing group to advise the government about the state of the housing market
13.More education for consumers about their real estate rates
14.Create more through reporting requirements for real estate sales
15.Improve reliability of elevators in Ontario buildings
16.Updating the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe 

Objectives

Determine the most cost effective price for renters and home buyers base on their household income. Even though factors like rise in unemployment rates increase in some of Canada's major cities housing prices are still rising. Mortgage rates have been sharply rising and owning a home has started to consume over 50% of the average household's monthly budget. We conclude that with increases in household debt, stagnant wages, and expected rises in interest rates, a decline is inevitable. How much a person needs to make as income to be able to able to afford rent or purchase a home.

Problem Statement

We will be focusing on making housing prices more affordable for renters and home buyer. By evaluating factors such as household income and debt to determining if there is a correlation between the cost of the housing in the major Canadian cities and the household income and debt.

Data Sources

The data that was gathered using third-party datasets collected from external source from Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The data sets include Rental rates, Median Income After Tax Renters, Average Monthly Debt Payments, Ownership Rates and Price Quartiles and Averages for Unabsorbed and Absorbed Homeowner and Condominium Units.

Collection Method

Secondary data collection was the process of obtaining the data for this project the data includes both qualitative and quantitative data. 

Analysis Methods

Limitations/Contraints

Project Timeline

Week 1:

oSignup for GitHub, research python libraries and data APIs. Start developing a topic area/dataset for inquiry.

Week 2:

oBegin data collection, assembling methodology for Exploratory Data Analysis. ETL work into data warehousing. Begin exploring data and documenting issues/limitations/needs understanding needs/limitations regarding research question (might need to adjust question, scope, data, etc.).

Week 3:

oSubmission of EDA sprint (via GitHub/Moodle). Collect/Augment/Refine project according to Sprint 1 findings. Develop several analytical methodologies (these should be methods you are interested in learning – like Topic modelling or sentiment analysis, or social network analysis, etc.)

Week 4:

oAll data collection should be completed. The methodology should be finalized.

Week 5

oSubmission of Sprint 2 to GitHub/. Includes codebase, report (brief), and plan for analysis.

Week 6

oStart final sprint prepare for final submission.

Week 7

oWork on final project.

Week 8

oFinal report – pdf/word doc 3-5 pages of background, research question, methodology, results, conclusion GitHub Repo. Well documented – meaning someone who comes across it randomly should know exactly what it is, how to re-create it, and what your repo contains Final notebooks/analysis/results. Each sprint notebook documented, detailed, and refined.
