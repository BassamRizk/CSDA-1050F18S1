# Abstract

The term of podcasting comes from a combination of the words iPod(a personal digital audio player made by Apple) and broadcasting. Podcasting is a free service that allows internet users to listen to audio files on their computers or personal digital audio players. The podcasting platforms make many people's dreams come true-have their own radio show or writing songs heard by many people. Podcasting is not only used for entainment but also used for informational and educational purposes such as self-guided walking tours, training etc.

We understood that podcasting doesn't have long history. It was developed in 2004. As the personal digital devices are become more popular and enter into almost everyone's life including babies. within 100 million+ podcast listeners in the U.S (according to https://www.adamenfroy.com/podcast-hosting)and between 7 and 10 million Canadians are listening to podcasts(according to a study from late 2017 conducted by Ulster Media and the Globe and Mail). 

# Problem Statment
A rapdily increasing of updating personal digital devices and internet speed, they are many new things happen every day and also people share their personal experiences on social media. Podcast as a product which belongs to information technology era doesn't have long history, but it definitely affect our life. Podcasting has experienced a huge surge of interest in past several year (especially in the past three to four years). With Google reporting up to 10 million monthly searches for "podcast" via the search engine giant in 2019 based on information from Listennotes website. There are so much potentials in this field but also competition heats up for different podcast platforms. 

Per Mr.Jeff Vidler from Audience Insights Inc mentioned in the project meeting, Podcasts reply on ads for their finance support but they have challenge to target the podcast listeners. The one major reason is podcast platforms can see listeners download the podcast episodes but unable to get much information about the listeners as almost all podcasts are completely free and listeners don't need to put their information such as credit card or names.

This project will analyze the podcasing listeners in Canada. In Canada, this is just 3rd year to analysis the podcasting data. We will focuse on some research questions below but will not limite to these.
* Does podcasting will continue growth every year in Canada? 
* Do devices affect listeners to listen podcast? Are age and gender big factors to podcast?
* Does location affect people to listen to podcast?
