### Sprint
Abstract: This is for the fulfillment of the York University’s Advanced Analytics Course Capstone Project. The aim of this project is to uncover insights from the social media space through programmatic means

Project Scope
Here are the boundaries of the project:
1.	Social media channel: Twitter (to include Facebook if time permits)
2.	Social media scope: Major Canadian Financial Institutions (FI) like BMO, CIBC, RBC, Scotiabank, TD (to include digital banks like Simplii, Tangerine, EQ if time permits)
3.	Comparison of the following insights across the above FIs: Sentiment Analysis (polarity and categorical); Word Cloud (conversation drivers); Key-word dendrogram (blend of sentiment and conversation drivers); Network Analysis (demographics and product segmentation). Paraphrases of these insights are given in the “Research Questions” section below

Research Questions
Here are the research questions for this project:
1.	Which bank has the most favourable / unfavourable trending opinion?
2.	What are the current financial products being discussed?
3.	What are the current emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) towards each bank?
4.	What are the current sentiments towards trending financial product segments / categories (and the general network of terms being tweeted)?

What is needed to be done to run it
1.	Go to http://apps.twitter.com to register for a developer's account
2.	Once approved, Twitter will provide four OAuth parameters to you:
	a.	API Key
	b.	API Token
	c.	Access Token
	d.	Access Token Secret
	These four parameters help you tap into Twitter's APIs to gather the tweets
3.	You will also need an R IDE (I use RStudio) to run the R codes
